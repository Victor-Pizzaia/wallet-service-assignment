The main goal is to structure the application domains based on the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD). To support the domain decomposition process, I adopted the hexagonal architecture. In order to follow DDD principles as closely as possible and avoid cross-domain coupling, I used Spring Modulith, which enables event publishing and listening.

I structured the application into three main domains: wallets, users, and transactions. For data persistence, I chose PostgreSQL â€” a robust, consistent, and Spring-compatible relational database that allows for strong modeling of entity relationships.
